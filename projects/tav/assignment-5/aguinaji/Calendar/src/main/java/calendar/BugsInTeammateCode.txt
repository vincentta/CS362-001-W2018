The first bug that was detected from my teammate’s calendar code was from the Appt class. After implementing and running my own test units for the Appt class on my teammates calendar code, one of my test failed. After analyzing the error, I found that a bug in his code is that for the startMinute. The test case showed that when initializing the startMinute to be 59, the test returns false even though the expected value should be true. When examining my teammate;s code, I saw that the conditional if statement in line 115 of Appt class checks to see if the startMinute is valid or not is incorrect. His code has a bug where it only validates only 59 minutes as true when it should be 60 minutes. The branch that checks the upper edge case limit of startMinute should be 59 not 58.
The second bug from my teammate’s code that was detected by my test units was from the CalDay class. When running my CalDay test unit, there was an error indicating there was a bug when adding appointments to the CalDay constructor. My test unit showed that the appointments were not being added in the correct order than what was expected. This is a result from line 114 and 115 being omitted so that the appt is not set correctly in the linked list if the appt is not null.
